        <p>Astrology is the study of the movement and positioning of the stars and planets around the earth. A zodiac sign is a symbol that represents somebody’s personality, emotions, and motivations. Everybody has many different signs, one for each planet,
            the moon, the sun, and many more. A moon sign dictates inner mood and emotions, while an ascending sign represents the impression others get from you. However, the sun sign is what is most commonly referred to, and used to explain a person’s
            basic nature and personality traits. While the characteristics of these signs may not apply to everyone, most people’s actions can be generalized by their sign. While you shouldn’t judge individuals based on these premises, you can line up
            their behavior with astrology, and teach them about themselves.
