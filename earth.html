        <h1>Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn</h1>

        <article>
            <h2>Are You "Earthy?"</h2>
            <p>Have you ever heard someone described as "earthy?" The term usually describes people who are oriented toward what's real, often making them very productive and able to create tangible results. But if there are no balancing elements, earth's
                extremes could lead to being a workaholic, hoarding of possessions, pettiness, getting stuck in the mundane, stubbornness, etc.</p>

            <h2> Different Modalities of Earth Signs </h2>

            <p>The modalities (or qualities) make the earth signs different—this is how you can know one from another. In their triplicity or grouping by element, they differ in that each belongs to another group known in astrology as "qualities." The qualities
                are Cardinal, Fixed, and Mutable. Capricorn is a Cardinal sign, known for its initiatory nature, Taurus is a Fixed sign, and it sinks into the Earth perhaps the deepest, and Virgo is a Mutable sign, characterized by changeability.</p>

            <p><img src="images/astrology.jpg" alt="Astrology" class="allzodiacs"></p>

            <h3>Earth and Water</h3>
            <p>Earth signs can help the emotional Water signs find tangible outlets for imaginative gifts. Like the banks to a flowing river, the Earth sign can guide the Water sign toward a goal. Water can help Earth by softening its rigid structure. Think
                about how a potter uses water to soften, and then re-shape clay on the wheel. Similarly, water nourishes the ground of Earth with a feeling of being cared for. </p>

            <h3>Earth and Fire</h3>
            <p>Inspirational quality of Fire signs brings a sense of adventure to the lives of Earth signs. Earth signs are be energized by Fire signs, as long as they take it slow. A little Fire goes a long way with Earth. On the other hand, Fire can be
                guided by Earth's mastery of structure. All those brilliant ideas can begin to take shape with Earth as your worldly advisor. </p>

            <p>
                <h3>Earth and Air</h3>
                <p>When Earth meets Air, it's like opening the window to let the fresh air in. It can be exhilarating to Earth to be lifted up if only temporarily, to see from the lofty heights of fantasy and rapid ideation. But if Air doesn't offer Earth
                    anything tangible, only pies in the sky, there could be a loss of respect. As with the other signs, Earth brings Air down to ground level and offers practical ways to take a concept to reality. Air can find Earth stuffy and slow, but
                    will begrudgingly respect the way they get things done.</p>

                <h3>Earth and Earth</h3>
                <p>Here is a power duo, able to build empires, plan things down to the last detail and always with one eye on preparing for the future. Theirs is a world full of things to see, touch, hear, taste and feel together. But two Earth signs can
                    fall into the trap of working for tomorrow and not living for today. They'll avoid this by seeking out sensual pleasures, and making time for relaxation in their "garden."
                </p>

                <h2>More info:</h2>
                <p>Some keywords might be: practical, useful, structure, productivity, tangible, grounded, sensual, tactile, dependable. Those with Earth signs often seem to inhabit their physical bodies which can be described in new-age terms as "grounded."
                    Whatever their ground is — whether it is a high-rise office building or rural cottage — they're sending out feelers through the senses. The physical is the densest plane, and they're masters at assessing and organizing tangible things.</p>

                <p>One expression of Earth sign qualities might be someone who is easy-going and languid, aware of the local flora and fauna, often have leaves in their hair or dirt on their hands. They're intimately attuned to the dance of nature, and love
                    to spend time outdoors.
                </p>

                <p>But Earth signs can just as easily work their magic in urban places since they're often centers of a certain kind of high-level productivity. The focus on the tasks at hand makes them vulnerable to the "all work and no play" cul de sac
                    of life.
                </p>

                <p>They're more apt to base their reality on what is around them in form, instead of creating personal myths or assigning symbolic meanings to everything. That's why too much of a good thing — Earth — can be stifling to things like inspiration,
                    going on faith, a sense of purpose.</p>

                <p>Earth signs are here to shape, manifest, cultivate and revel in Earthly delights. Their gift to others is bringing form to ideas, making them a balancing partner for an idle dreamer with potential. They tend their own garden and inspire
                    others to make the most of theirs.</p>
