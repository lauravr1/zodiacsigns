        <h1>Aries, Leo, Sagittarius</h1>

        <article>
            <h2>Are you "Fiery?"</h2>
            <p>Those with planets in fire signs have a simmering at-the-ready stance as they hunt for things that light them up. They're prone to sudden illuminating flashes of insight and bursts of enthusiasm. Like fire itself, they can flare up when inspired,
                making them seem very passionate about life. They like to live large and often feel frustrated by mundane chores and duties. <br> Fire signs are known to be intuitive and to rely on gut instincts. Going on faith in their inner guidance
                gets them far, but they tend to skip crucial steps or be unaware of the emotional impact of their actions. Another grouping in astrology is known as the qualities: cardinal, fixed, and mutable. Each element has a sign with one of the qualities.
                Among fire signs, Aries is cardinal, Leo is fixed, and Sagittarius is mutable.

                <h3> Fire and Water</h3>
                <p>The greatest gift is being able to inspire, which appeals to water's desire for meaning. A generous fire person shows water how to be in the moment, even if they're carrying lots of psychological baggage. Water takes fire on an emotional
                    journey that helps them see how they're related to others. At its worst and most out of balance, fire can zap water by being totally overwhelming, and water smothers fire when it offers only insular, claustrophobic intimacy.</p>

                <h3> Fire and Earth</h3>
                <p>Sometimes fire has lots of visionary ideas that earth can help put into tangible form. This can make pragmatic earth feel needed and appreciated, not to mention that fire's enthusiasm is contagious. If earth becomes too slow and plodding
                    for fire, this match could get snagged in frustration. Through earth's eyes, fire may seem unrealistic and unwilling to do the legwork to make things happen.</p>


                <h3> Fire and Air</h3>
                <p>When fire and air get together, there can be a lot of inspired thinking. Fire helps air find focus when scattered and adds optimism to any plans. Air can articulate the big picture for the impulse-driven fire, while the latter keeps things
                    from being all talk and no action. These two keep each other in stitches, open the doors of perception, and find new ways to astonish the other.

                    <h3> Fire and Fire </h3>
                    <p>When fire meets fire, life can be an exuberant adventure. It's a vital match, with mutual inspiration and encouragement. The challenge comes when fiery temperaments turn into struggles for dominance. If there is only drama without
                        emotional foundation, this match can burn itself out.



                        <h3>More info:</h3>
                        <p>When the fire element is present, there's a warm radiance, a trust in life's journey and a willingness to take risks. Any party or celebration is made better with the presence of a fully charged fire sign. They're great catalysts
                            for play, liable to unearth the spontaneity of those around them. Because they sense a golden thread of destiny and potential running through their lives, they have a knack for leading others to theirs.</p>

                        <p>Fire signs act on instinct, or "sixth sense," which makes them look reckless to more cautious types. They're following a powerful intuition that keeps them at the leading edge of fresh experiences. </p>

                        <p>Fire is infused with the divine spark, which can spread like wildfire to everyone around them. Their lust for life is enviable. Those who are weighed down might try to toss a wet blanket on their enthusiasm, so fire must vigilantly
                            guard its beacon. It's important for them to have cheerleaders to fan the flames of their interests. But fire who thinks only of itself learns the wisdom of the other elements the hard way. They'll keep coming up against resistance
                            until there is a willingness to see there are no shortcuts. Each of the other elements has something to offer, and in return, fire gives off a glow that is as nourishing as the rays of the sun. </p>
