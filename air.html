        <h1>Gemini, Libra, Aquarius</h1>

        <article>
            <h2>Social Curiosity</h2>
            <p>The air signs are social creatures, because their currency is ideas, and they'll find more stimulation when out mingling. Some are drawn to words and become professional communicators, while others—especially Aquarius—have a more conceptual
                way of thinking. Air signs are masters at navigating through the collective waters and therefore are astute commentators of the cultural trends, attitudes, and the consciousness of the times.

                <p>When air is out of balance, you can encounter a talking head, someone cut off from his or her own physical self. Air signs are more vulnerable to the excesses of our mind-body split and could benefit from yoga and other somatic practices.</p>

                <p>In relationships, the distance of air to their emotions can be refreshing. They're great conversationalists because they're the keepers of so much knowledge, gossip, trivia, and strange factoids. Talking with an inspired air sign can be
                    like skipping through a kind of virtual reality full of detail, specificity, and local color.</p>

                <h2>Big Mind</h2>
                <p>Those with planets in air signs use their minds to make sense of their lives. With air, there's more space between the life lived and the observing mind. This can lead air signs to appear detached, aloof, remote, or cool. Sometimes they'll
                    try to talk their way through feelings or analyze a situation instead of encountering its full emotional weight. The gift of air is flexibility and their ability to experience life through many prisms. They're often excellent communicators,
                    storytellers, interpreters, and journalists. They link people together socially and often have a curiosity that keeps them out and about.

                    <h3>Air and Earth </h3>
                    <p>It can be a relief for a weighted-down earth person to be lifted up by an air's ideas and freethinking. An air may offer a different spin on how to prioritize things, which can be liberating for a duty-bound earth. An earth helps a
                        remote air discover the mind-body connection. Earths can also advise airs so that some of their dreams can be made real.</p>

                    <h3>Air and Fire </h3>
                    <p>This is a dynamic combo, with an air being able to inspire a fire through thought. Airs help fires take a more logical path toward success, some direction for their leaps of faith. A fire gives an air a sense of mission or purpose
                        and shines a light of focus through a jumble of collected data, thoughts, and information.</p>

                    <h3>Air and Water</h3>
                    <p>These two benefit from each other by bringing balance to feeling and thought. Waters show airs a path to feelings and can help them grow toward being more nurturing and emotionally expressive. A water helps an air make the heart connection.
                        An air lifts a water out of the murky swamp into the realm of thought. Like talk-therapy, airs encourage waters to find distance and to become intellectually curious about their experiences.</p>

                        <h3>Air and Air </h3>
                        <p>Here is a meeting of the minds, and when balanced by other elements, it can mean a lifetime of shared interests. The way of connecting is through the exchange of ideas. The deeper emotional truth of the situation at hand can be
                            discussed coolly. This bond thrives when there is also emotional authenticity, action, and physical touch.</p>
